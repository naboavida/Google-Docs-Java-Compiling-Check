# Google-Docs-Java-Compiling-Check
A Google Docs add-on to validate syntax and compilation errors on Java code existing on a document

Install this add-on following the instructions in https://developers.google.com/apps-script/quickstart/docs, but instead of copy-paste the code pointed on that website, use the files on this repository.

How to use this add-on?
- Create or open a document on Google Docs
- On the toolbar, click "Add-ons" and then on "Java Syntax Check"
- On the right side, the add-on allows for two functions: a) filter the document to pick only a part of it, from the limits input; and b) validate the code in between the limits input.
